Project Structure:

* Frontend: Unity project for playing the game
* AI: C++ source for Kin AI

# Building

For now, easiest build is opening Visual Studio in the `AI` directory, building everything there (Ctrl-Shift-B or Build->Rebuild All), opening `frontend` in the Unity Editor, and building the project there.
